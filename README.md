# Secret Hitler: Telegram

**A Telegram bot that allows users to play [Secret Hitler](https://www.secrethitler.com/).**

There is an instance running under `@SuperSecretHitlerBot`, but be aware that the bot state currently doesn't survive reboots and I reboot my server regularly, so you might want to host yourself.

## Commands

See [commands.txt](commands.txt) for a list of available commands and descriptions.  Note that some commands are only available to certain players in certain game states.
If you host a bot instance, this files contents can be put into `@BotFather` so that Telegram shows these in the command menu.

## Player Status Abbreviations
- (P) indicates a current president/presidential candidate.
- (C) indicates a current chancellor/chancellor candidate.
- (TL) indicates a term-limited player (ineligible for any chancellor nominations).
- (CNH) indicates a player that is confirmed not to be hitler (by having been elected after 3 fascist policies).
- (RIP) indicates a dead player.

## Configuration

To get the bot working, you need to create the folder `config` and place these files there.

- **API token:** Stored in `config/key` but withheld with `.gitignore`. To replicate this project, make a Telegram bot by messaging `@BotFather` and pasting the resulting API key there.
- **Username:** Stored without the "@" in `config/username`.
- **Devchat:** Stored in `config/devchat` the chat id of a chat where the bot sends its maintenance messages.
